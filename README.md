## FAQ accordion ðŸª— (this pet-project is still under development)  

---
I decided to create this pet project to practice my skills with reactive components, creating them from scratch. I often see this element on modern web sites and I was interested to try to implement it myself. Initially I planned to use only html, css, js to create the component, but later I decided to complicate the task and realise the pet project with the react library. I included the vite builder into the project.
